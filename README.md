# GitRecording

We began this project at HackViolet 2022. Here is the [link](https://devpost.com/software/gitrecording) to our demo!

We had implemented recording functionality, but we wanted to play back the code with the recorded audio for our user, so in this project, we designed and implemented an application using MEAN stack architecture.

Note: Import recordings.json before testing.
